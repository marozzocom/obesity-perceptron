# Obesity Prediction Perceptron

A simple perceptron program to predict obesity based on height and weight.

## What is a Perceptron?

A perceptron is a basic form of artificial neural network. It learns to make predictions by adjusting its internal weights based on training data.

## How This Program Works

Unlike a simple BMI calculator, this perceptron:

1. Generates its own training data based on BMI calculations
2. Learns patterns from this data
3. Makes predictions (that may differ from strict BMI classifications)

The program demonstrates how a simple machine learning model can learn and apply patterns from data.

## Running the Program

1. Install Bun from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)

2. Install dependencies

   ```
   bun i
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```
   bun run index.ts
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts.
